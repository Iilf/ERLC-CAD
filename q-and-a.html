                <p class="text-gray-400 whitespace-pre-line">📖 <strong>In-Game Regulations</strong>
                
                At New York Roleplay, we strive to maintain a standard of realism and professionalism that brings the world of Liberty County to life. These game regulations exist to preserve immersion, promote fair and engaging interactions, and ensure that all members experience the highest quality of roleplay possible.
                
                <strong>(1.0) Realism and Immersion</strong>
                Every action you take in-game must align with realistic standards. Avoid using unrealistic avatars, outfits, or vehicles that break immersion. Always roleplay your vehicle crashes and any situation that would logically impact your character’s condition.
                
                <strong>(1.1) Random Deathmatch (RDM)</strong>
                Engaging in random or unjustified acts of violence against other players is strictly prohibited. You must always have a valid and roleplay-based reason before using deadly force.
                
                <strong>(1.2) Vehicle Deathmatch (VDM)</strong>
                Intentionally using a vehicle to harm or destroy another player or their property without valid roleplay justification is not allowed. 
                
                <strong>(1.3) Character Continuity</strong>
                When your character dies, you are to treat that moment as the end of their storyline. You may not reference knowledge, relationships, or events from your previous life.
                
                <strong>(1.4) Fear Roleplay (FearRP)</strong>
                Your character must always value their life. If a weapon is drawn and aimed at you, you are required to act accordingly — you cannot pull out a weapon or act without fear.
                
                <strong>(1.5) Arrest and Detainment Procedures</strong>
                All arrests must be fully roleplayed. Officers are expected to follow realistic procedures — giving commands, using communication, and maintaining professionalism throughout.
                
                <strong>(1.6) Robbery and Group Crimes</strong>
                Major crimes such as robbing the Jewelry Store or Liberty County Bank require at least two or more players participating to ensure coordination and realism.</p>
